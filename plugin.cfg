name="Building Culler 3D"
description="Building Culler allows you to manage the showing/hiding of upper levels of your 3D buildings when your character enters. This is useful for third-persongames where the camera collisions make navigating interiors difficult.

Add a Building node to denote your building, and create BuildingLevel nodes inside of it for each level of your building. All objects inside on your BuildingLevel's will have their visibility, physics, and processing culled if the player enters a floor that is lower than the associated floor.

Don't forget to add a BuildingLevel for your roof, especially for single-story buildings, to cull the roof when the player enters."
